# GE-2-Assignment

This is inspired by a scene in Mass effect 2 --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fMV-syIHx4

I could only get the steering and follow behaviours to work, so it is very basic. 

I used navigation mesh or NavMesh in order to pathfind for the main ship and the smaller drones chase after using regular transform position follows. 

The reason the ship doesn't rotate is due to the rotations bugging out everytime I didn't lock them. Therefore I decided to lock the uprotation and rotation in navmesh.

Here is the video of it running: https://youtu.be/1gwCt6TTt_w

Thank you!
